  <h3>Launch Status: <small><strong>private beta</strong></small></h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>Evography.com</strong> is currently in the private beta stage, this means we have invited a select group of users to use the service, 
        help us refine it and work out any bugs.  <br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        We aim to have our public beta available by the beginning of <strong>January 2012</strong>, 
        but as this is a new service we will be taking on a limited number of new clients on a monthly basis. <br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        If you would like to be considered for one of these <strong>advance memberships</strong> or be informed when the site officially goes live to the 
        public, just drop us your name and email and we will keep you up to date. <br /><br />
